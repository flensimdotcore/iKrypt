# iKrypt
Firmware for IoT personal storage 'iKrypt"

In this repository you can find source code files in Arduino programming language with implemented
stepper motor motion control, Bluetooth communication with iOS app "iKrypt" that is being developed specifically for this project.
Code for RFID hasn't been done yet.

Storage motherboard is designed in Altium Designer 20. It is considered as Arduino shield for Arduino Mega 2560.
It contains Bluetooth module headers and RFID module headers as well as sockets for DIR/STEP stepper motor drivers control. 
PCBs dimensions were defined by design engineer and it implies the addition of new features to the board.
